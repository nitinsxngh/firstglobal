Our systems track entry and exit times, issue badges, \nand screen visitors against watchlists, ensuring that only authorized \npersonnel gain access to your facility.\nSystem Capabilities:\nPre-Registration: Allowing hosts to pre-approve guests via app or \nemail for faster check-in.\nBadge Printing: Instant creation of photo ID badges with access \nprivileges encoded.\nAudit Trails: Digital logs of every visitor movement for compliance \nand security audits.Surveillance\nIntelligent Eyes Everywhere. Beyond simple recording, our surveillance \nsolutions utilize AI-driven analytics. We provide proactive monitoring \nthat detects anomalies, tracks movement, and provides real-time \nalerts.\nAdvanced Features:\nBehavioral Analytics: Identifying suspicious loitering or unattended \nbaggage automatically.\nNight Vision & Thermal: Ensuring visibility in zero-light conditions or \ndense fog.\nRemote Monitoring: Centralized command centers that watch \nover multiple sites simultaneously.Parking Management\nOptimized Arrival. We transform parking from a hassle into a \nstreamlined operation. Our management systems optimize space \nutilization, control vehicle access, and ensure the safety of vehicles.\nSolutions:\nAutomated Boom Barriers: RFID-enabled entry for authorized \nemployees.\nGuidance Systems: Sensors and digital signage guiding drivers to \nthe nearest empty slot.\nTicketless Entry: ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) for \nseamless access.Integrated Smart Traffic Management\nControlled Flow. For campuses and large complexes, internal traffic \nflow is a safety priority. We implement smart signaling and traffic \nmarshaling protocols to prevent congestion.\nTraffic Solutions:\nSignage & Marking: Professional road marking and signage to \ndesignate lanes and pedestrian zones.\nSpeed Control: Installation of speed breakers and monitoring \ncameras to enforce campus speed limits.\nMarshaling: Trained personnel to direct traffic during peak hours or \nshift changes.Incidence Response Mechanis m\nSpeed. Strategy. Resolution. When an alarm triggers, seconds count. \nOur automated incidence response mechanisms integrate sensors \nwith communication channels, ensuring immediate mobilization.\nWorkflow:\nAutomated Alerts: Immediate SMS and email notifications to \nsecurity heads upon sensor breach.\nSOP Activation: Digital checklists for guards to follow during \nspecific emergencies (fire, intrusion).\nPost-Incident Reporting: Automated generation of incident reports \nfor legal and insurance purposes.Perimeter Protectio n\nThe Iron Shield. We secure your boundaries using a blend of physical \nbarriers and electronic intrusion detection systems. We ensure that \nyour perimeter is impenetrable to unauthorized access.\nL ayers of Defense:\nPIDS (Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems): Fiber optic sensors on \nfences that detect cutting or climbing attempts.\nElectric Fencing: Non-lethal, deterrent high-voltage fencing for \nhigh-security zones.\nMotion Sensors: Microwave and infrared beams creating an invisible \nwall around the property.Vendor Management\nSecure Supply Chains. Security risks often enter through the back \ndoor. Our vendor management protocols vet external suppliers and \ncontractors.\nProcess:\nKY C & Vetting: Thorough background checks on all vendor \npersonnel entering the premises.\nMaterial Movement: Strict checking of goods in and goods out to \nprevent pilferage.\nAccess Z ones: Restricting vendor access only to loading docks and \nspecific service areas.Access Contro l\nPrecision Entry. Control is the core of security. We implement \nbiometric, card, and mobile-based access control systems that \nensure the right people have access to the right areas at the right \ntimes.\nTechnologies:\nBiometrics: Fingerprint and facial recognition for high-accuracy \nidentification.\nMobile Credentials: U sing smartphones as k eys for convenient, \ntouchless entry.\nAnti-Passback: Preventing a single access card from being used by \nmultiple people to enter.services / visitor-managementservices / surveillanceservices / parking-managementsmart-traffic-managementservices / incidence-responseservices / perimeter-protection\n/ services / vendor-managementservices / access-control\nInformation Security & Integrated System s\nSmart Technology for a Smarter Perimeter. FirstGlobal bridges the gap between physical security and digital intelligence. We deploy advanced technological frameworks to monitor, control, and analyze your security landscape, transforming raw data into safety."
